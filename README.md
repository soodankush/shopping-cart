# Ecommerce website created using ReactJs

This project is based on online shopping cart. I have created a website(a basic one) which implements the 
shopping cart APIs from the [Fakestore](fakestoreapi.com). As the website had the dummy APIs only, so I wasn't 
able to modify the data present in the APIs. I had achieved the implementation of various hooks in the following project.

* useState
* useReducer
* useContext
* useParams
* Custom Hook to fetch API data
* useFetch
* useEffect

The basic objective to deep dive into the concepts of the ReactJs has been achieved.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
